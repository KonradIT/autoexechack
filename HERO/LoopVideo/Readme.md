#Looping Video for the HERO 2014

Whether you want to use it as a dash cam to film some russian adventures or record the longest ski run, this hack will allow you to use the feature only found in the newer GoPro heros directly in your $129 GoPro HERO.

Choose the duration you want, click a folder, click autoexec.ash, right click on RAW, choose SAVE AS, save as in the root of the SD card where DCIM and MISC are. Turn it on and it acts like in Quick Capture, it will start recording looping videos. Perfect for Dash cam.

SimpleLoop will do the simplest of functionality. Record, delete, repeat. Make sure you get to your recorded file and turn off your GoPro before that second part, or else your totally-only-took-one-try triple trampoline flip will be lost forever. The restart recording process takes 5 seconds total, so it's recommended you customize the timer in the script to something longer than the 5 minute default. Use of this script will also delete all previously recorded media in SD:/DCIM at the end of each recording cycle.

With the new functionality in the more advanced versions (or maybe I should say "totally broken"), the previous clips will be stored in appropriate folders in DCIM.
  * For the two minute script, up to 5 clips are saved in the "loop"
  * For the five minute script, up to 3 clips are saved in the "loop"
  * For the ten minute script, up to 2 clips are saved in the "loop"
